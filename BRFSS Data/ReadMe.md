## About the Project

The data is taken from the course of "Statistics with R" of Duke University from Coursera. The goal was to perform Exploratory Data analysis
on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS) dataset provided. The name of the module was "Introduction to Probability and Data.
The aim was to come up with at least three research questions that can be used to answer using these data.
The research question should be phrased in a way that matches up with the scope of inference the dataset allows for.
