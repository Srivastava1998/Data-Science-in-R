## About the a Titanic Project

The dataset of Titanic is taken from kaggle.com. The data is also available in the R package named "titanic".

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 
On April 15, 1912, during it's maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this project, we will see if we are able to gather some insights and predict whether the next person will survive or not.
